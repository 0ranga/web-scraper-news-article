# A little web scraper from DevProjects

This project is just a little web scraper for The Washington Post.

I followed the guidelines given by DevProjects that you can find at this link [Web scraper to get news article content](https://www.codementor.io/projects/tool/web-scraper-to-get-news-article-content-atx32d46qe/solutions)
